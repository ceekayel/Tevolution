---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- Remove advance search shortcode and modification in advance search widget.

- Login & Register - Social media login for FB, Twitter, G+ included by default, Login, Register links will be pop up forms.

- All New Submission process - Rearranged into different steps (1,2,3,4). Easier for users to submit

- Default form fields are kept to minimum and removed fields which were not absolutely necessary

- In submission form, you start typing your address and it automatically starts suggesting you addresses (from the city you have selected as your location)

- Price Packages section in backend now has a link for all price packages. This can skip the “package selection” step if you come to that direct URL. This also opens up possibility for users to show their packages table the way they want.

- Authors should be able to change the category while editing the listing. The already selected category while submission will be disabled for selection.
 Manage transactions management, Price packages management
 Payment gateway – if only one payment gateway is available, it will simply go to payment gateway to collect payment instead of showing it on the next step (thus, reduced a step)

- Improved search & filters – instead of two fields (what, where), we will have one, global search field which will show instant results while typing. This improves location discovery to a great extent. Criteria for this can be managed from the widget in wp-admin.

- Search results page – works and designed in the same way that category pages are working

- Images- Front end – users can not only browse and upload but can also drag and drop images into that area now (disabled in IE).
  Standardized image sizes – mini thumb, thumb, bigger, etc. (so as to avoid many version of the same image being created and saves lots of space)
  
- In submission form, you start typing your address and it automatically starts suggesting you addresses

- You don’t have to click “set address on map” button anymore. As you type the address, it automatically sets the map accordingly.

- Some Tevolution Modules moved as free add-ons:	Bulk Import/Export, Security Manager, Manage Coupons

- Use admin-Ajax instead of cusotm ajax.

- "Are you human" not supported with new version.

- Advance seach change completely.
